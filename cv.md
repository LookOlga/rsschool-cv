## About

Before I started to learn web development, I had worked as a web and graphic designer. I was curious how websiies are made so I decided to look into it. And that's how my adventure began.
I became more and more intrested in web development. The most part that I like that there are many opportunities to grow and develop your skills. 

I have good knowledge of HTML, CSS and basic knowledge of JavaScript and Vue. Every day I am learning something new. I would like to gain work experience in a company, get new knowledge and develop my skills.
